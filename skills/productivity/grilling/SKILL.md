name: grilling
description: Grill the user relentlessly about a plan, decision, or idea. Use when the user wants to stress-test their thinking, or uses any 'grill' trigger phrases.

Interview the user relentlessly until you reach a shared understanding. Map this as a **design tree**: every decision branches into the decisions that hang off it.

Work the tree in **rounds**. The **frontier** is every decision whose prerequisites are already settled: the questions you can ask _now_ without guessing at answers you haven't heard yet. Ask the whole frontier in one round: send it as one Plannotator Inbox message (the `plannotator_inbox` tool's `send_message`), one `:::question` block per question, numbered Q1, Q2, … Then end your turn and wait — the person's answers arrive back in this session by themselves (call `wait_for_reply` when the tool says they don't).

Format each question as a block like so (first line is the question, then context, then choices, then your recommendation):

```
:::question
Q1. <question title>?

<context: what the choice affects, what you know or tried, why you recommend this — one to three short sentences>

- [ ] <choice> — <why>
- [ ] <choice> — <why>

Recommended: <choice label>
:::
```

Mark your pick only with the `Recommended:` line — never "(recommended)" in a choice label. Word each question so "yes" accepts your recommended answer. No `plannotator_inbox` tool in this session? Ask the round in chat instead, one numbered question per message block, with your recommendation under it.

Each round the user answers reshapes the tree: settled decisions push the frontier outward and unblock questions that depended on them. Recompute the frontier and ask the next round. A question whose answer depends on another question still open in this round belongs to a _later_ round, not this one.

Finding _facts_ is your job, never the user's. When a frontier question needs a fact from the environment (filesystem, tools, etc.), dispatch a sub-agent to find it; don't ask the user for anything you could look up yourself. Don't block on it: a running exploration is an unsettled prerequisite, so only the questions downstream of it wait for the sub-agent to report; ask the rest of the frontier now. The _decisions_ are the user's: put each to them and wait.

The session is done when the frontier is empty: every branch of the design tree visited, nothing left silently assumed. Do not act on it until the user confirms you have reached a shared understanding.
